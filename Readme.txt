A game of Spock, Scissors, Paper, Rock, Lizard.
The bot uses grand seed time:NULL, to properly get a randomized choice.

The player inputs a number from 0-4, and in a variable the bots choice is subtracted from the players choice.
The value of this variable is used in a switch statement, where the case i determined by the value, and decides who wins, or if there is a tie.
Points are then added to the variables of either the players points of the bots points.
All of this is happening inside a do while statement, that continues to loop, until either of the variables for points reaches 5.
